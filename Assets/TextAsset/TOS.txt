While you are using the Game, please be aware of your surroundings, and play and communicate safely. You agree that your use of the Game is at your own risk and that you will not use the Game to violate any applicable law, regulation, or instructions as outlined in these Terms and you will not encourage or enable any other individual to do so.

You agree that in conjunction with your use of the Game, you will maintain safe and appropriate contact with other users and other people in the real world. You will not harass threaten or otherwise violate the legal rights of others. You will not trespass, or in any manner attempt to gain or gain access to any property or location where you do not have a right or permission to be, and will not otherwise engage in any activity that may result in injury, death, property damage, nuisance, or liability of any kind. 

<b>J. Health and Safety Precautions</b>

The below should be reviewed before use of the Game. Failing to review the below health and safety precautions may cause damage to property, injury, or death. These health and safety precautions are not intended to be an exhaustive list, and use of the Game may involve other health and/or safety risks not contained herein. Another Axiom is not liable for any damage to property, injury, or death that may occur as the result of your failure to review the health and safety precautions or as a result of the interactions between you or your family members and people or objects in or around the play area during your use of the Game.

1. Epileptic Seizure Warning. Please note that certain people are susceptible to epileptic seizures or loss of consciousness when exposed to certain flashing lights or light patterns, even if they have never experienced epileptic symptoms or been previously diagnosed with epilepsy. Such people may have a seizure while watching certain images on screens, including virtual reality headsets, or playing certain video games, including the Game. If you or anyone in your family has ever had symptoms related to epilepsy (seizures or loss of consciousness in particular) when exposed to flashing lights, you should consult your doctor prior to playing the Game. Stop playing the Game and consult a doctor if you have any of the following symptoms: convulsions; eye or muscle twitching; loss of consciousness or awareness; altered vision; involuntary movements; or disorientation. Another Axiom is not liable for any death, injury, or health complications resulting from any epileptic symptoms or conditions which may occur during or as a result of your use of the Game. To reduce the likelihood of a seizure or epileptic symptoms do not play the Game when tired or need sleep and take 10 or 15 minute breaks every 30 minutes while playing the Game.
2. Motion Sickness. Playing video games (especially virtual reality games), including the Game, may cause motion sickness in some users. If you feel dizzy or nauseous when playing the Game, stop playing and rest. Do not drive, operate heavy machinery, or engage in other demanding or strenuous activity until you feel better. To limit the risk of motion sickness while playing the Game, do not use the Game when you are tired, need sleep, are under the influence of alcohol or drugs, are hung-over, have digestive problems, are under emotional stress or anxiety, or when suffering from cold, flu, headaches, migraines, or earaches or other health issues which may increase your susceptibility to adverse symptoms.
3. Repetitive Motion Injuries and Eyestrain. Playing video games, including the Game, can make your muscles, joints, skin or eyes hurt. To avoid problems such as tendinitis, carpal tunnel syndrome, skin irritation or eyestrain: avoid excessive play; take a 10 to 15 minute break every 30 minutes while playing the Game; if your hands, wrists, arms, eyes, or other parts of your body become tired or sore while playing, or if you feel symptoms such as tingling, numbness, burning, or stiffness, stop and rest for several hours before playing again; and if you continue to have any of the above symptoms or other discomfort during or after playing the Game, stop playing and consult a doctor.
4. Play Area Precautions. Give yourself plenty of room to play the Game. Always be aware of your surroundings when playing the Game. While playing the Game in virtual reality you will be moving around the play area and using your hands to control gameplay. Make sure the play area is clear of furniture, objects, and other people that could be bumped into during gameplay. Please ensure that you are not near other people, stairs, balconies, windows, walls, furniture, or other objects that may pose a danger to you or could be damaged or injured during or immediately after using the Game. All objects that may pose tripping hazards, could cause injury, or could be damaged as the result of your contact with them while playing the Game should be removed from the play area prior to your or your family members playing the Game. A minimum six-feet-by-six-feet unobstructed play area is recommended for safe enjoyment of the Game. Never handle sharp or dangerous objects while playing the Game. Due to the immersive nature of the Game, sound volumes should be kept at low enough levels that you are able to maintain awareness of your surroundings while playing the Game and so as not to damage your hearing. You should not use the Game if your awareness of your surroundings is impaired by lack of sleep, drugs, alcohol, the effects of a hang-over, stress, anxiety, or when suffering from a cold, flu, headaches, migraines, or other illnesses.

<b>K. Limited License to Broadcast Gameplay</b>

Another Axiom believes that the Game is best served by an active and excited community of users. To encourage community growth and development, we hereby grant each valid user of the Game (“<b>Broadcasting User</b>”) a limited, revocable, royalty-free license to broadcast such Broadcasting User’s unique play within the Game (“<b>Broadcasted Content</b>”), but only through third-party media that is, at the time of broadcast, currently approved by Another Axiom (“<b>Approved Broadcaster(s)</b>”). In furtherance of your exercise of the foregoing limited license, you may assume that other users who participate in gameplay with you have given you nonexclusive performance rights for their parts in your Broadcasted Content, unless or until you have notice that they opt out in accordance with the provisions outlined below. To the extent a user opts out, our license with respect to Broadcasted Content including that user is revoked.

The above limited license to broadcast the Game is subject to the additional conditions:

1. A Broadcasting User may only broadcast their own gameplay;
2. All Broadcasted Content must otherwise comply with these Terms and the Privacy Policy;
3. Broadcasting Users assume all liability for ensuring their Broadcasted Content, and any monetization of Broadcasted Content, fully complies with all applicable laws, as well as the Approved Broadcaster(s)’ applicable terms of service, policies, rules, and guidelines; and 
4. Another Axiom may revoke a user’s license to broadcast for any or no reason and without notice.
 
Any user may revoke such user’s permission to a Broadcasting User to be included in Broadcasted Content by providing written notice to the Broadcasting User of their decision to opt out (“<b>Opt-Out Notice</b>”). Without any obligation to do so, Another Axiom may also provide Opt-Out Notices on a case-by-case basis on behalf of users. Upon receipt of an Opt-Out Notice, the Broadcasting User must promptly remove the Broadcasted Content or otherwise modify the Broadcasted Content to remove the other user(s). Another Axiom does not assume any responsibility for ensuring compliance with the foregoing.

The following is an exclusive list of currently Approved Broadcasters. Modifications to this list may be made here or elsewhere in the Game. Users may only broadcast content through currently Approved Broadcasters. We do not claim any affiliation with the Approved Broadcasters, nor do we make any representations as to the quality or functionality of the Approved Broadcasters’ services.

2. YouTube, LLC
3. Meta Platforms, Inc.
4. Twitter Inc.
